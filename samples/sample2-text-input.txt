Create a web-based task management system using React and Node.js. The system should help teams collaborate on projects.

Features needed:
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Assign tasks to team members
- Set due dates and priorities
- Track task status (todo, in progress, done)
- Add comments and attachments to tasks
- Create project boards with multiple columns
- Real-time updates when team members make changes

Technical requirements:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Real-time: WebSockets for live updates
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Must be responsive and work on all modern browsers

The UI should be clean and intuitive, similar to Trello or Asana. Users should be able to drag and drop tasks between columns.
