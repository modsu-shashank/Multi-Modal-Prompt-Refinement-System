Build a fitness tracking mobile application that helps users monitor their health and fitness goals.

Core functionality:
- Log daily workouts (cardio, strength training, yoga, etc.)
- Track calories consumed and burned
- Monitor heart rate during exercises
- Set and track fitness goals (weight loss, muscle gain, endurance)
- View progress charts and statistics
- Integration with wearable devices (Fitbit, Apple Watch)
- Weekly progress reports via email

The app should have a motivational design with vibrant colors. It needs to sync data across devices using cloud storage. Users should be able to share achievements on social media.

Technical stack:
- Native mobile app (React Native for cross-platform)
- Cloud database for data sync
- Integration APIs for wearable devices
- Push notifications for workout reminders
