Design and develop a restaurant reservation system. The system needs two interfaces:

For customers:
- Browse restaurant availability
- Make online reservations
- View menu items
- Receive email confirmations
- Cancel or modify reservations

For restaurant staff:
- View all reservations in a calendar
- Accept or reject reservation requests
- Manage table availability
- Send reminder notifications
- View customer history

The system should support multiple restaurants and allow customers to filter by cuisine type, location, and price range. It must integrate with email services for sending confirmations and reminders.

Platform: Web application accessible from desktop and mobile browsers. Should work on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
